### Overview

We need to create the \[name of table\] table so that we can update a shared data store across hackforla.org, vrms, civictechjobs, and tables (onboarding) project.

#### Details

A table and a model are the same thing

### Action Items

- [ ] identify if table has a description (see spreadsheet under Resources)
    - [ ] if not, reach out to PD leads
- [ ] identify and document  (below) what other tables are associated (see ERD under Resources)
- [ ] create a single model in Django (defining schema)
- [ ] Write a test for the relationships this model will have with other models (e.g., creating a user and assigning them a set of permissions on a project).
- [ ] Write an API end point
- [ ] write API unit tests
- [ ] Document the endpoint in Swagger
