### Overview

We need to create the [ADD NAME OF TABLE] table so that we can update a shared data store across hackforla.org, vrms, civictechjobs, and tables (onboarding) project.

#### Details

A table and a model are the same thing

### Action Items

- [ ] Identify if table has a description (see spreadsheet under Resources)
    - [ ] If not, reach out to PD leads
- [ ] Identify and document (below) what other tables are associated (see ERD under Resources)
- [ ] Create a single model in Django (defining schema)
- [ ] Write a test for the relationships this model will have with other models (e.g., creating a user and assigning them a set of permissions on a project).
- [ ] Write an API end point
- [ ] Write API unit tests
- [ ] Document the endpoint in Swagger

- [ ] In ERD only (having items here indicates a mismatch, which requires a review)

    - None [or REPLACE WITH FIELD NAME - TYPE]

- Check to see if open issues in `FK status` below

    - [ ] If all Issues listed are closed (or there are no FKs), then skip the next 3 steps
        - [ ] comment out the code after you create it (see FK Status below for open/closed state)
        - [ ] add an action item on the open issue to uncomment the code line you commented out when that issue's table is created.
        - [ ] Provide your file and line number as a permalink under resources in that issue

### FK status

- [#ISSUE NUMBER OF ANY FK TABLE(S)]

### Associated Tables

1. Copied from spreadsheet and checked off according to ERD. (unchecked items indicate a mismatch between ERD and spreadsheet, which requires a review)

    - [ ] \[ENTER NAME OF ASSOCIATED TABLE, relation in brackets (e.g., `(one-to-many)`), and #issue number\]

1. In ERD only (having items here indicates a mismatch, which requires a review)
