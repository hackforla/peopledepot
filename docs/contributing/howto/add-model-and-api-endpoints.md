# Add new model and API endpoints

This guide aims to enable developers with little or no django experience to add django models and API endpoints to the project. Most code examples are followed by detailed explanations.

??? note "The developer will have exposure to the following in this document"

    - python
    - django
    - django rest framework
    - relational database through the Django ORM (object-relational mapper)
    - data types
    - object-oriented concepts (object, inheritance, composition)
    - unit testing
    - API design
    - command line

This guide assumes the developer has followed the [working with issues guide](issues.md) and have forked and created a local branch to work on this. The development server would be already running in the background and will automatically apply the changes when we save the files.

We will choose the [recurring_event issue](https://github.com/hackforla/peopledepot/issues/14) as an example. Our goal is to create a database table and an API that a client can use to work with the data. The work is split into 3 testable components: the model, the admin site, and the API

Let's start!

## Data model

??? note "TDD test"

    1. Write the test

        We would like the model to store these data, and to return the name property in the str function.

        In `app/core/tests/test_models.py`

        ```python title="app/core/tests/test_models.py" linenums="1"
        def test_recurring_event_model(project):
            from datetime import datetime

            payload = {
                "name": "test event",
                "start_time": datetime(2023, 1, 1, 2, 34),
                "duration_in_min": 60,
                "video_conference_url": "https://zoom.com/mtg/1234",
                "additional_info": "long description",
                "project": project,
            }
            recurring_event = RecurringEvent(**payload)
            # recurring_event.save()
            assert recurring_event.name == payload["name"]
            assert recurring_event.start_time == payload["start_time"]
            assert recurring_event.duration_in_min == payload["duration_in_min"]
            assert recurring_event.video_conference_url == payload["video_conference_url"]
            assert recurring_event.additional_info == payload["additional_info"]
            assert recurring_event.project == payload["project"]
            assert str(recurring_event) == payload["name"]
        ```

        For testing many-to-many relationships, we can add

        ```python title="app/core/tests/test_models.py" linenums="1"
        def test_project_recurring_event_relationship(project):
            recurring_event = RecurringEvent.objects.get(name="{Name of Recurring Event}")

            project.recurring_events.add(recurring_event)
            assert project.recurring_events.count() == 1
            assert project.recurring_events.contains(recurring_event)
            assert recurring_event.projects.contains(project)

            project.sdgs.remove(recurring_event)
            assert project.recurring_events.count() == 0
            assert not project.recurring_events.contains(recurring_event)
            assert not recurring_event.projects.contains(project)
        ```

    1. See it fail

        ```bash
        ./scripts/test.sh
        ```

    1. Run it again after implementing the model to make sure the code satisfies the test

### Add the model

Add the following to `app/core/models.py`

```python title="app/core/models.py" linenums="1"
class RecurringEvent(AbstractBaseModel):  # (1)!
    """
    Recurring Events
    """

    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    start_time = models.TimeField("Start", null=True, blank=True)  # (2)!
    duration_in_min = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)  # (3)!
    video_conference_url = models.URLField(blank=True)
    additional_info = models.TextField(blank=True)  # (4)!

    project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # (5)!
    # location_id = models.ForeignKey("Location", on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)
    # event_type_id = models.ForeignKey("EventType", on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)
    # brigade_id = models.ForeignKey("Brigade", on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)
    # day_of_week = models.ForeignKey("DayOfWeek", on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)
    # must_roles = models.ManyToManyField("Role")
    # should_roles = models.ManyToManyField("Role")
    # could_roles = models.ManyToManyField("Role")
    # frequency_id = models.ForeignKey("Frequency", on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)

    def __str__(self):  # (6)!
        return f"{self.name}"
```

1. We inherit all models from AbstractBaseModel, which provides a `uuid` primary key, `created_at`, and `updated_at` timestamps. In the Github issue, these fields might be called `id`, `created`, and `updated`. There's no need to add those.
1. Most fields should not be required. Text fields should be `blank=True`, data fields should be `null=True`.
1. The data types in the github issue may be given in database column types such as `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, but we need to convert them into [Django field types](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#model-field-types) when defining the model.
1. `VARCHAR` can be either `CharField` or `TextField`.
    1. `CharField` has a `max_length`, which makes it useful for finite length text data. We're going default to giving them `max_length=255` unless there's a better value like `max_length=2` for state abbreviation.
    1. `TextField` doesn't have a maximum length, which makes it ideal for large text fields such as `description`.
1. Try to add the relationships to non-existent models, but comment them out. Another developer will complete them when they go to implement those models.
1. Always override the `__str__` function to output something more meaningful than the default. It lets us do a quick test of the model by calling `str([model])`. It's also useful for the admin site model list view.

??? note "Updating models.py for many-to-many relationships"

    For adding many-to-many relationships with additional fields, such as `ended_on`, we can add

    ```python title="app/core/models.py" linenums="1"
    class Project(AbstractBaseModel):
        ...
        recurring_events = models.ManyToManyField(
            "RecurringEvent",
            related_name="projects",
            blank=True,
            through="ProjectRecurringEventXref",
        )
        ...


    class ProjectRecurringEventXref(AbstractBaseModel):
        """
        Joins a recurring event to a project
        """

        recurring_event_id = models.ForeignKey(RecurringEvent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        project_id = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        ended_on = models.DateField("Ended on", null=True, blank=True)
    ```

    For adding many-to-many relationships without additional fields, we can just add

    ```python title="app/core/models.py" linenums="1"
    class Project(AbstractBaseModel):
        ...
        recurring_events = models.ManyToManyField(
            "RecurringEvent",
            related_name="projects",
            blank=True,
        )
        ...
    ```

    which leaves out the "through" field and the "join table" will be created implicitly.

### Run migrations

This generates the database migration files

```bash
./scripts/migrate.sh
```

??? note "Test"

    Since we overrode the `__str__` function, we need to write a test for it.

    1. Add a fixture for the model

        Fixtures are reusable code that can be used in multiple tests by declaring them as parameters of the test case. In this example, we show both defining a fixture (recurring_event) and using another fixture (project).

        Note: The conftest file is meant to hold shared test fixtures, among other things. The fixtures have directory scope.

        Add the following to `app/core/tests/conftest.py`

        ```python title="app/core/tests/conftest.py" linenums="1"
        @pytest.fixture
        # (1)!
        def recurring_event(project):  # (2)!
            # (3)!
            return RecurringEvent.objects.create(name="Test Recurring Event", project=project)
        ```

        1. We name the fixture after the model name (`recurring_event`).
        1. This model makes use of the `project` model as a foreign key relation, so we pass in the `project` fixture, which creates a `project` model.
        1. We create an object of the new model, passing in at least the required fields. In this case, we passed in enough arguments to use the `__str__` method in a test.

    1. Add a test case

        When creating Django models, there's no need to test the CRUD functionality since Django itself is well-tested and we can expect it to generate the correct CRUD functionality. Feel free to write some tests for practice. What really needs testing are any custom code that's not part of Django. Sometimes we need to override the default Django behavior and that should be tested.

        Here's a basic test to see that the model stores its name.

        Add the following to `app/core/tests/test_models.py`

        ```python title="app/core/tests/test_models.py" linenums="1"
        def test_recurring_event(recurring_event):  # (1)!
            # (2)!
            assert str(recurring_event) == "Test Recurring Event"  # (3)!
        ```

        1. Pass in our fixture so that the model object is created for us.
        1. The `__str__` method should be tested since it's an override of the default Django method.
        1. Write assertion(s) to check that what's passed into the model is what it contains. The simplest thing to check is the `__str__` method.

    1. Run the test script to show it passing

        ```bash
        ./scripts/test.sh
        ```

??? note "Check and commit"

    This is a good place to pause, check, and commit progress.

    1. Run pre-commit checks

        ```bash
        ./scripts/precommit-check.sh
        ```

    1. Add and commit changes

        ```bash
        git add -A
        git commit -m "feat: add model: recurring_event"
        ```

## Admin site

Django comes with an admin site interface that allows admin users to view and change the data in the models. It's essentially a database viewer.

### Register the model

In `app/core/admin.py`

1. Import the new model

    ```python title="app/core/admin.py" linenums="1"
    from .models import RecurringEvent
    ```

1. Register the model with the admin site

    ```python title="app/core/admin.py" linenums="1"
    @admin.register(RecurringEvent)  # (2)!
    class RecurringEventAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):  # (1)!
        list_display = (  # (3)!
            "name",
            "start_time",
            "duration_in_min",
        )  # (4)!
    ```

    1. We declare a [ModelAdmin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) class so we can customize the fields that we expose to the admin interface.
    1. We use the [register decorator](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.register) to register the class with the admin site.
    1. [list_display](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display) controls what's shown in the list view
    1. [list_filter](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter) adds filter controls to declared fields (useful, but not shown in this example).

### View the admin site

Check that everything's working and there are no issues, which should be the case unless there's custom input fields creating problems.

1. See the [development setup guide section on "Build and run using Docker locally"](dev_environment.md#build-and-run-using-docker-locally) for how to view the admin interface.

1. Example of a custom field (as opposed to the built-in ones)

    ```python
    # (1)!
    time_zone = TimeZoneField(blank=True, use_pytz=False, default="America/Los_Angeles")
    ```

    1. Having a misconfigured or buggy custom field could cause the admin site to crash and the developer will need to look at the debug message and resolve it.

??? note "Test"

    1. Feel free to write tests for the admin. There's no example for it yet.
    1. The reason there's no tests is that the admin site is independent of the API functionality, and we're mainly interested in the API part.
    1. When the time comes that we depend on the admin interface, we will need to have tests for the needed functionalities.

??? note "Check and commit"

    This is a good place to pause, check, and commit progress.

    1. Run pre-commit checks

        ```bash
        ./scripts/precommit-check.sh
        ```

    1. Add and commit changes

        ```bash
        git add -A
        git commit -m "feat: register admin: recurring_event"
        ```

## API

There's several components to adding API endpoints: Model(already done), Serializer, View, and Route.

### Add serializer

This is code that serializes objects into strings for the API endpoints, and deserializes strings into object when we receive data from the client.

In `app/core/api/serializers.py`

??? note "Updating serializers.py for many-to-many relationships"

    Following the many-to-many relationship between project and recurring event from above,

    Update the existing serializer classes

    ```python title="app/core/api/serializers.py" linenums="1"
    class ProjectSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        """Used to retrieve project info"""

        recurring_events = serializers.StringRelatedField(many=True)

        class Meta:
            model = Project
            fields = (
                "uuid",
                "name",
                "description",
                "created_at",
                "updated_at",
                "completed_at",
                "github_org_id",
                "github_primary_repo_id",
                "hide",
                "google_drive_id",
                "image_logo",
                "image_hero",
                "image_icon",
                "recurring_events",
            )
            read_only_fields = (
                "uuid",
                "created_at",
                "updated_at",
                "completed_at",
            )


    class RecurringEventSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
        """Used to retrieve recurring_event info"""

        projects = serializers.StringRelatedField(many=True)

        class Meta:
            model = RecurringEvent
            fields = (
                "uuid",
                "name",
                "start_time",
                "duration_in_min",
                "video_conference_url",
                "additional_info",
                "project",
                "projects",
            )
            read_only_fields = (
                "uuid",
                "created_at",
                "updated_at",
            )
    ```

1. Import the new model

    ```python title="app/core/api/serializers.py" linenums="1"
    from core.models import RecurringEvent
    ```

1. Add a serializer class

    ```python title="app/core/api/serializers.py" linenums="1"
    class RecurringEventSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):  # (1)!
        """Used to retrieve recurring_event info"""

        class Meta:
            model = RecurringEvent  # (2)!
            fields = (
                "uuid",
                "name",
                "start_time",
                "duration_in_min",
                "video_conference_url",
                "additional_info",
                "project",
            )
            read_only_fields = (
                "uuid",  # (3)!
                "created_at",
                "updated_at",
            )
    ```

    1. We inherit from [ModelSerializer](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#modelserializer). It knows how to serialize/deserialize the Django built-in data fields so we don't have to write the code to do it.
    1. We do need to pass in the `model`, the `fields` we want to expose through the API, and any `read_only_fields`.
    1. `uuid`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` are managed by automations and are always read-only.

1. Custom data fields may need extra code in the serializer

    ```python
    time_zone = TimeZoneSerializerField(use_pytz=False)  # (1)!
    ```

    1. This non-built-in model field provides a serializer so we just point to it.

1. Custom validators if we need them

    We will need to write custom validators here if we want custom behavior, such as validating URL strings and limit them to the github user profile pattern using regular expression, for example.

    ```text
    Example here when we have one
    ```

### Add viewset

Viewset defines the set of API endpoints for the model.

In `app/core/api/views.py`

1. Import the model

    ```python title="app/core/api/views.py" linenums="1"
    from ..models import RecurringEvent
    ```

1. Import the serializer

    ```python title="app/core/api/views.py" linenums="1"
    from .serializers import RecurringEventSerializer
    ```

1. Add the [viewset](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/) and CRUD API endpoint descriptions

    ```python title="app/core/api/views.py" linenums="1"
    @extend_schema_view(  # (2)!
        list=extend_schema(description="Return a list of all the recurring events"),
        create=extend_schema(description="Create a new recurring event"),
        retrieve=extend_schema(description="Return the details of a recurring event"),
        destroy=extend_schema(description="Delete a recurring event"),
        update=extend_schema(description="Update a recurring event"),
        partial_update=extend_schema(description="Patch a recurring event"),
    )
    class RecurringEventViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):  # (1)!
        permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]  # (4)!
        queryset = RecurringEvent.objects.all()  # (3)!
        serializer_class = RecurringEventSerializer
    ```

    1. We inherit from [ModelViewSet](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#modelviewset), which provides a default view implementation of all 6 CRUD actions: `create`, `retrieve`, `partial_update`, `update`, `destroy`, `list`.
    1. We use the `extend_schema_view` decorator to attach the API doc strings to the viewset. They are usually defined as docstrings of the corresponding function definitions inside the viewset. Since we use `ModelViewSet`, there's nowhere to put the docstrings but above the viewset.
    1. The minimum code we need with `ModelViewSet` are the `queryset`, and the `serializer_class`.
    1. Permissions
        1. For now use `permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]`
        1. It doesn't control permissions the way we want, but we will fix it later.

??? note "Extended example: Query Params"

    This example shows how to add a filter params. It's done for the [user model](https://github.com/hackforla/peopledepot/issues/15) as a [requirement](https://github.com/hackforla/peopledepot/issues/10) from VRMS.

    1. Here's a more complex API doc example (this example is using the User model's ViewSet)

        ```python title="app/core/api/views.py" linenums="1"
        @extend_schema_view(
            list=extend_schema(  # (2)!
                summary="Users List",
                description="Return a list of all the existing users",
                parameters=[
                    OpenApiParameter(
                        name="email",
                        type=str,
                        description="Filter by email address",
                        examples=[
                            OpenApiExample(
                                "Example 1",
                                summary="Demo email",
                                description="get the demo user",
                                value="demo-email@email.com,",
                            ),
                        ],
                    ),
                    OpenApiParameter(
                        name="username",
                        type=OpenApiTypes.STR,
                        location=OpenApiParameter.QUERY,
                        description="Filter by username",
                        examples=[
                            OpenApiExample(
                                "Example 1",
                                summary="Demo username",
                                description="get the demo user",
                                value="demo-user",
                            ),
                        ],
                    ),
                ],
            ),
            create=extend_schema(description="Create a new user"),  # (1)!
            retrieve=extend_schema(description="Return the given user"),
            destroy=extend_schema(description="Delete the given user"),
            update=extend_schema(description="Update the given user"),
            partial_update=extend_schema(description="Partially update the given user"),
        )
        class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
            pass
        ```

        1. Define strings for all 6 actions: `create`, `retrieve`, `partial_update`, `update`, `destroy`, `list`.
        1. This one is fancy and provides examples of data to pass into the query params. It's probably more than we need right now.
            1. The examples array can hold multiple examples.
                1. Example ID string has to be unique but is not displayed.
                1. `summary` string appears as an option in the dropdown.
                1. `description` is displayed in the example.

    1. Add any query params according to the requirements (this example is using the User model's ViewSet)

        ```python title="app/core/api/views.py" linenums="1"
        class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
            ...

            def get_queryset(self):  # (1)!
                """
                Optionally filter users by an 'email' and/or 'username' query paramerter in the URL
                """
                queryset = get_user_model().objects.all()  # (2)!
                email = self.request.query_params.get("email")
                if email is not None:
                    queryset = queryset.filter(email=email)
                username = self.request.query_params.get("username")
                if username is not None:
                    queryset = queryset.filter(username=username)
                return queryset
        ```

        1. Notice the `queryset` property is now the `get_queryset(()` function which returns the queryset.

            The `get_queryset()` function overrides the default and lets us filter the objects returned to the client if they pass in a query param.

        1. Start with all the model objects and filter them based on any available query params.

### Register API endpoints

In `app/core/api/urls.py`

1. Import the viewset.

    ```python title="app/core/api/urls.py" linenums="1"
    from .views import RecurringEventViewSet
    ```

1. [Register](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/#usage) the viewset to the [router](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/)

    ```python title="app/core/api/urls.py" linenums="1"
    router.register(r"recurring-events", RecurringEventViewSet, basename="recurring-event")
    # (1)!
    ```

    1. Params
        1. First param is the URL prefix use in the API routes. It is, by convention, plural
            - This would show up in the URL like this: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recuring-events/` and `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recuring-events/<uuid>`
        1. Second param is the viewset class which defines the API actions
        1. `basename` is the name used for generating the endpoint names, such as <basename>-list, <basename>-detail, etc. It's in the singular form. This is automatically generated if the viewset definition contains a `queryset` attribute, but it's required if the viewset overrides that with the `get_queryset` function
            - `reverse("recurring-event-list")` would return `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recuring-events/`

??? note "Test"

    For the CRUD operations, since we're using `ModelViewSet` where all the actions are provided by `rest_framework` and well-tested, it's not necessary to have test cases for them. But here's an example of one.

    In `app/core/tests/test_api.py`

    1. Import API URL

        ```python title="app/core/tests/test_api.py" linenums="1"
        RECURRING_EVENTS_URL = reverse("recurring-event-list")
        ```

    1. Add test case

        ```python title="app/core/tests/test_api.py" linenums="1"
        def test_create_recurring_event(auth_client, project):
            """Test that we can create a recurring event"""

            payload = {
                "name": "Test Weekly team meeting",
                "start_time": "18:00:00",
                "duration_in_min": 60,
                "video_conference_url": "https://zoom.com/link",
                "additional_info": "Test description",
                "project": project.uuid,
            }
            res = auth_client.post(RECURRING_EVENTS_URL, payload)
            assert res.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED
            assert res.data["name"] == payload["name"]
        ```

        1. Given
            1. Pass in the necessary fixtures
            1. Construct the payload
        1. When
            1. Create the object
        1. Then
            1. Check that it's created via [status code](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/status-codes/#client-error-4xx)
            1. Maybe also check the data. A real test should check all the data, but we're kind of relying on django to have already tested this.

    1. Run the test script to show it passing

        ```bash
        ./scripts/test.sh
        ```

??? note "Test many-to-many relationships"

    In `app/core/tests/test_api.py`

    1. Import API URL

        ```python title="app/core/tests/test_api.py" linenums="1"
        PROJECTS_URL = reverse("project-list")
        ```

    1. Add test case (following the example above)

        ```python title="app/core/tests/test_api.py" linenums="1"
        def test_project_sdg_xref(auth_client, project, recurring_event):
            def get_object(objects, target_uuid):
                for obj in objects:
                    if str(obj["uuid"]) == str(target_uuid):
                        return obj
                return None

            project.recurring_events.add(recurring_event)
            proj_res = auth_client.get(PROJECTS_URL)
            test_proj = get_object(proj_res.data, project.uuid)
            assert test_proj is not None
            assert len(test_proj["recurring_events"]) == 1
            assert recurring_event.name in test_proj["recurring_events"]

            recurring_event_res = auth_client.get(RECURRING_EVENT_URL)
            test_recurring_event = get_object(recurring_event_res.data, recurring_event.uuid)
            assert test_recurring_event is not None
            assert len(test_recurring_event["projects"]) == 1
            assert project.name in test_recurring_event["projects"]
        ```

    1. Run the test script to show it passing

        ```bash
        ./scripts/test.sh
        ```

??? note "Check and commit"

    This is a good place to pause, check, and commit progress.

    1. Run pre-commit checks

        ```bash
        ./scripts/precommit-check.sh
        ```

    1. Add and commit changes

        ```bash
        git add -A
        git commit -m "feat: add endpoints: recurring_event"
        ```

??? note "Push the code and start a PR"

    Refer to the [Issues page section on "Push to upstream origin"](issues.md#push-to-upstream-origin-aka-your-fork) onward.
