# Updating the ERD

This page outlines how to **view**, **edit**, and **propose changes** to the People Depot entity relationship diagram (ERD), which is managed using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/).

## üìå Purpose

## üîç Viewing the Live ERD

To view the current version of the ERD:

- Visit: **Live ERD (dbdiagram.io)** ‚Üí [link](https://dbdiagram.io/d/People-Depot-Schema-ERD-68917d4edd90d178656e4061)

!!! note

    üìù You do **not** need an account to view the ERD

    1. Open a PR from your fork to the `main` branch of `PeopleDepot`

## üõ† Tips and Conventions

- Use **clear, singular table names** (e.g., `Person`, not `People`)
- Always define **primary keys** and **foreign keys**
- Maintain consistent **naming conventions** (e.g., `snake_case` or `camelCase`, as established)
- Include **comments in DBML** for any complex relationships or logic
