# PeopleDepot

PeopleDepot is a project of Hack for LA, a brigade of a Code for America. PeopleDepot provides backend infrastructure to provide a single source of truth for all Hack for LA projects. The {app/site/thing you're building}'s main features include {very brief feature descriptions}.

## Project context

Civic projects often exist within a larger context that may include multiple stakeholders, historic relationships, associated research, or other details that are relevant but not *required* for direct contributions. Gathering these details in one place is useful, but the ReadMe isn't that place. Use this section to [link to a Google Doc](#) or other documentation repository where contributors can dig in if they so choose. This is also a good place to link to your Code of Conduct.
